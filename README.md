# KeyValueCache

## Purpose
- Work with Go
- Practice writing tests in Go
- Learn more about structs and interfaces
- Grow project over time to add other technologies and learning goals

## Technologies
- Go
- Goland (IDE)
- Stretchr/testify API (github.com/stretchr/testify)
_more soon_

## User Stories
- As a user I want a simple data structure, a **`key-value cache`** that holds a unique set of key:value pair of strings
- As a user I want a method that allows me to add (**aka "create"**) a unique `key` and a `value` to the `cache`
- As a user I want a method that allows me to **"read"** a `value` from the `cache` by providing just the unqiue `key`
- As a user I want a method that allows me to **"update"** a `value` in the `cache` by providing the original, unique `key` and the new `value`
- As a user I want a method that allows me to **"delete"** a unique `key-value` pair in the `cache
- As a developer I want unit tests for each method on the key-value cache server
- As a developer I want the cache to eventually work like a model/server for a CLI that allows users to store data and persists data
- More developer stories details coming soon from Scott
